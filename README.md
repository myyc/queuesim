This is a toy that simulates a queue system in your favourite office or
supermarket. Arrival times follow an exponential distribution with a
default `λ = 1` while serving times follow a Pareto distribution,
with a default `α = 0.6`, because you really want the idiot with all
the paperwork and 500€ in coins to show up in a queue every now and then.

* Depends on `numpy` and `arcade`
* Launch with `python pqueue.py` (no arguments available)
* Arrow keys change the parametres on the fly, `q` or `ESC` to quit.
